# Logistic Regression from Scratch and with Scikit-Learn

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to implement Logistic Regression both from scratch and using the Scikit-Learn library in Python. Logistic Regression is a popular statistical model used for binary classification problems. This notebook walks you through the underlying concepts, implementation details, and provides practical examples.
